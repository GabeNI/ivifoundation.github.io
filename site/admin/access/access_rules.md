<td><p>Use this page to manage access rules for your Web site. Rules are applied to folders, thus providing robust folder-level security enforced by the ASP.NET infrastructure. Rules are persisted as XML in each folder's Web.config file. <em>Page-level security and inner-page security are not handled using this tool — they are handled using specialized code that is available to the Web Developers.</em></p>

<p>Rules are applied in order. The first rule that matches applies, and the permission in each rule overrides the permissions in all following rules. Use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to change the order of the selected rule. Rules that appear dimmed are inherited from the parent and cannot be changed at this level.</p>
