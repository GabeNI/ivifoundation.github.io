# VXI*plug&play*

The VXI*plug&play* standards were originally created by a predecessor
of the IVI Foundation called the VXI*plug&play* Systems Alliance.
The alliance accomplished major improvements in ease of use
by endorsing and implementing common standards and practices in both
hardware and software, beyond the scope of the VXIbus specifications.

## Integration into the IVI Foundation

The VXI*plug&play* Systems Alliance voted to become part of the IVI
Foundation in late 2002 and the IVI Foundation Board of Directors voted
to accept the merger in the spring of 2003. IVI has working groups
that continue to maintain and enhance several of the VXI*plug&play* standards
including the VISA standard for IO, that has been extended including:

- Linux support
- Extensions for secure communication with instruments
- APIs in C, .NET, and LabVIEW.

The current, IVI-maintained VXI*plug&play* specifications are available at
[Specifications](../specifications/default.html).
