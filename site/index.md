The IVI Foundation is an open consortium founded to promote
specifications for programming test instruments that simplify
interchangeability, provide better performance, and reduce the cost of
program development and maintenance.

## What is IVI?

The IVI Foundation develops and maintains diverse standards that
simplify test system development and maintenance when using software
and hardware components from multiple vendors.  These standards includes:

* General purpose standards regarding instrument drivers for use in various 
  development environments. That establish a high standard for the quality and
  completeness of those drivers.  Including an industry-wide registration 
  mechanism for all conformant instrument drivers.

* Standards that specify APIs of specific classes of instruments that 
  facilitate interchanging instruments.

* The SCPI standard which specifies the strings that can be sent 
  to instruments to control them.

* Standards regarding APIs used in programs that control instruments
  to send and receive the strings specified by SCPI.
  
* Standards related to how messages are transferred between instruments
  and computers.
