# The IVI Driver Registry

The IVI Foundation maintains a registry of IVI conformant drivers.  This is an
essential part of driver standardization as it provides a mechanism for the 
foundation to ensure that drivers legitimately comply with the 
IVI Standards.

One important function of the registry is that it provides a convenient place for 
system developers to locate drivers for any given instrument.

Driver developers are required to register drivers to claim compliance with
IVI.  In the registration authors declare the instrument models supported, the standards
the drivers comply with and the testing (required by IVI) that has been 
completed on the drivers.

If it comes to the IVI Foundations attention that a driver is not fully conformant
with the specifications, the foundation initiaties a process with the publisher and provides
the publisher an opportunity to resolve any problems with the driver.  
If the problems are verified and not corrected, the foundation withdraws
the driver from the registry.
