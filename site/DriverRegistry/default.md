# The IVI Driver Registry

The IVI Foundation maintains a registry of IVI conformant drivers.  This is an
essential part of driver standardization as it provides a mechanism for the 
foundation to ensure to customers that drivers legitimately comply with the 
IVI Standards.

Driver developers are required to register drivers, and declare the standards
they comply with, and also document the testing (required by IVI) that has been 
completed on their drivers.

One important function of the registry is to provide a convenient place for 
system developers to locate drivers for any given instrument.

If it comes to the IVI Foundations attention that a driver is not fully conformant
with the specifications, it  initiaties a process with the publisher and provides
the published an opportunity to resolve any verified problems with the driver.  
If the problems are not rectified, the driver is withdrawn from the registry.
