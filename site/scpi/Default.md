# The SCPI Standard

The Standard Commands for Programmable Instrumentation (SCPI) Standard
provides
a common interface language between computers and test instruments. The
SCPI Standard is built on the foundation of IEEE-488.2, Standard Codes
and Formats. It requires conformance to IEEE-488.2, but is pure software
standard. SCPI syntax is ASCII text, and therefore can be attached to
any computer test language, such as Python, C, or C#. It can also be
used with Test Application Environments such as LabWindows/CVI, LabVIEW,
MATLAB, Microsoft Visual Studio, or Agilent VEE. SCPI is
hardware-independent. SCPI strings can be sent over any instrument
interface. It works equally well over GPIB, RS-232, VXIbus or LAN
networks.

# Integration into the IVI Foundation
 
The SCPI Consortium merged with the IVI Foundation in late 2003. 
IVI is responsible for all ongoing work on the SCPI
standard.  

The IVI Foundation HiSLIP standard provides for
the delivery of 
[SCPI](../downloads/Protocol%20Specifications/IVI-6.1_HiSLIP-2.0-2020-04-23.pdf) 
messages to devices over the network, and
includes the meta-messages used for instrument control over GPIB.

To view/download SCPI, go to the
[Specifications](../specifications/default.html)
page.
