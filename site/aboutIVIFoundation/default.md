# About the IVI Foundation

These pages will help you learn more about the IVI Foundation organization.

The IVI Foundation provides various standards that facilitate creating
multi-vendor instrument systems. IVI was originally formed with a focus on
instrument drivers (also known as virtual instruments) and facilitating interchanging
instrument within test systems.  However, it has expanded to include:

* Standards for general purpose drivers

* Standards for instrument IO (such as VISA)

* Standard for direct instrument control (SCPI) and instrument communication (HiSLIP)
