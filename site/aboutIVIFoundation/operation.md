# How the IVI Foundation Operates

The IVI foundation was incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation in
the State of Delaware in March 2001. IVI is an open consortium of users,
systems integrators and instrument vendors. The consortium was founded
to promote specifications for programming test instrument that simplify
interchangeability, provide better performance, and reduce the cost of
program development and maintenance.

##  Technical Meetings

The IVI Foundation Technical Committee is responsible for the technical 
content of the IVI standards. Both member and non-member companies are
invited to participate in the development of standards.  Companies can send as many representatives as they want to
meetings of the Technical Committee or its working groups.  Member companies gets
one vote regardless of the number of representatives they send. 

Meetings are
held in person, or by tele-conference. Active groups typically 
meet via teleconference every week or two.  Face-to-face meetings
are held 3-4 times per year, they usually last 2-3 days with multiple
tracks.  An agenda is published in advance. Individuals can choose to
attend only the portions of the meeting that interest them. Attendees are
charged nominal meeting fees to cover the cost of meeting space,
continental breakfast and lunch.
