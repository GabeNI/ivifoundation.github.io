year. My thanks to National Instruments for helping me find the hotel.

The hotel is near the airport (abour 6.5 miles) but for shopping and
restaurants you may want a car. For transportation from the Airport, the
hotel provides shuttle service. Go to the hotel kiosk at the airport and
find the Marriott South Airport, dial the front desk and they will send
a shuttle (about 10-15 minutes).
