We�re holding the IVI Boston Meeting, Wed., 10/17 � Fri., 10/19 at the
Woburn/Boston North Courtyard Marriott hosted by The MathWorks.  
  
**Hotel Room Reservations:  
**  
*By phone:  
  
* Reservations for the hotel rooms will be made by individual attendees
directly with Courtyard by Marriott reservations at (781) 938-9001.
Reservations must be received on or before ***Wednesday, September 26,
2007***, or whenever the room block is filled. At the Cutoff Date or
when the block is filled, the Courtyard will review the reservation
pickup, release the unreserved rooms, if any, for general sale, and
determine whether it can accept reservations based on a space- and
rate-available basis at the IVI Foundation�s group rate after this date.
Mention �IVI Foundation� to get the group rate of $129/night (regular
rate is $179/night). The hotel seems adamant about sticking with this
cutoff date for this meeting, so I would not count on this being
extended. There is a strong demand for rooms in Boston at this time.  
  
*Online:  
*  
Go to the hotel website at
[www.marriott.com/boscw](http://www.marriott.com/boscw) and enter the
group code, IVIIVIA, in the Group code box on the right of the home page
in the Check Rates & Availability section. Then follow the instructions
to reserve your room. If everything is correct you�ll see the room rate
of $129/night and a designator IVI Foundation � Math.  
  
**Meeting Registration:  
**  
Please email Barb Estes at <bode.admin@comcast.net> to register for the
meeting with the days you�ll be attending to secure food reservations
and name tags.  
  
For the first time at this meeting, we will be charging a flat rate of
$200/person for the meeting to everyone, regardless of how many days you
attend, which will be collected via credit card whenever you arrive.
(This new process was approved by the Board at the last meeting to
simplify registration.)  
  
Let me know if you have any questions. See you there\!
