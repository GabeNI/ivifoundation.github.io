**[Meeting Agenda](Oct%202017%20Agenda%20-%20IVI.pdf)**

  
We are holding our October IVI Meeting from Monday, Oct. 16 --
Wednesday, Oct. 18. We are staying at the **Courtyard by Marriott
Portland City Center**, cost of the room is $179 per night with our
IVI-LXI block rate. I'm suggesting a couple of things:

> 1\. Make your room reservation using the registration link below as
> soon as possible, and don't forget to register with
> [Julie](mailto:admin.lxi@lxistandard.org), so you're in the headcount
> for catering. (Julie Minor has replaced Barb Estes as
> administrator/bookkeeper for the IVI Foundation.)
> 
> 2\. As always, please stay at this hotel in Portland, instead of
> somewhere else, because we need everyone's participation to meet the
> terms of the contract. If we fall short of our promised room
> reservations, IVI and LXI will pay penalties for the lost revenue. IVI
> is overlapping the LXI meeting on Wed. morning for our joint
> Cybersecurity meeting as you know, and we have estimated that IVI and
> LXI will both be present at Wednesday's lunch.

> **IVI Meeting Fee:**
> 
> We will be trying something new at this meeting to make the collection
> of meeting fees more efficient. Bob will estimate the meeting fees for
> attendees and call-ins prior to the meeting, and collect credit card
> payments for the attendees' meeting fees in Portland. For the
> call-ins, their meeting fees will be collected after the Board
> verifies who called in.
