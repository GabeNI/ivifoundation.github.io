We are holding our IVI Meeting in Boston, MA *at Teradyne* from Tues.,
Oct. 16 - Fri., Oct. 19, 2018.

**Hotel:** We are staying at the **Hilton Boston/Woburn**, cost of the
room is $154 per night with our LXI-IVI block rate. Internet included.

I'm suggesting a couple of things:

> 1\. Make your hotel room reservation using the registration link below
> as soon as possible, and don't forget to register with [Barb
> Estes](mailto:admin@ivifoundation.org), so you're in the headcount for
> catering *at Teradyne*. We will be sending this list of attendees to
> Teresa, so she can arrrange catering and security badges.
> 
> 2\. As always, please stay at this hotel in Boston instead of
> somewhere else, because we need everyone's participation to meet the
> terms of the contract. If we fall short of our promised room
> reservations, IVI and LXI will pay penalties for the lost revenue. IVI
> is overlapping the LXI meeting on Wed. afternoon for our joint
> Cybersecurity as you know, and we have estimated that IVI and LXI will
> both be present at Wednesday's lunch.
