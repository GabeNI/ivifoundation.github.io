**[Meeting Agenda](Feb%202017%20Agenda%20-%20IVI_rev1.pdf)**

  
We are holding our February IVI Meeting from Mon., Feb. 6 - Wed. morning
until 1:30pm (including lunch), Feb. 8, 2017. We are staying at the
**The Hampton Inn Tropicana**, total cost of the room is $138.88 per
night including the 12.5% Las Vegas occupancy tax with our block rate.
This was a difficult hotel to contract, because there's a lot going on
that week in Las Vegas. So I'm suggesting a couple of things:

1\. Make your room reservation using the registration link below before
your break for the holidays, if possible.

2\. Please stay at this hotel, instead of somewhere else in Las Vegas,
because we need everyone's participation to meet the terms of the
contract. If we fall short of our promised room reservations, IVI and
LXI will pay penalties for the lost revenue. IVI is overlapping the LXI
meeting on Wednesday morning as you know, and we have estimated that IVI
and LXI will both be present at Wednesday's lunch.

An unusual benefit of this hotel is that they offer a ***full breakfast
buffet*** with your room, so be sure to take advantage of that.
Therefore, we will not be serving a continental breakfast in the main
meeting room.

***Note*** that there are two new agenda items on our agenda: Wednesday
morning joint IVI/LXI meeting on cyber security from 8:30 am - 12:30 pm
followed by a joint lunch from 12:30 pm - 1:30 pm.
