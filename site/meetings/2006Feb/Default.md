We have chosen the location of our upcoming IVI Foundation meeting
February 7-9, 2006 in San Diego, CA. We have gotten a VERY good room
rate of $119.00 /night, which is great for San Diego at this time of
year. These rooms are reserved under the name IVI Foundation and are
eligible for the special group rate of $119/night. You can call (800)
922-2336 or (619) 222-0561 to make reservations, or you can book online
with the following steps:  

1.  Go to the Island Palms Web site
    ([www.islandpalms.com](http://www.islandpalms.com)).
2.  Click **ONLINE RESERVATIONS** on the left of the screen.
3.  Select the check-in information, enter **GBode** in the Promotional
    Code field, and click **Check Availability**.
4.  On the rooms page, scroll down and reserve either the **King
    Non-view** or the **Double Non-view**.

**NOTE: Reservations MUST be made by January 6, 2006 to receive this
group rate.

The Island Palms is located about seven minutes from San Diego Airport.
A complimentary airport shuttle is available from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm by
calling the hotel direct at (619) 222-0561 from the Baggage area. Taxis
are available at less than $10. A rental car is probably not necessary
as there are many good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.
The hotel also offers free internet access to its guests, as well as
free parking should you decide to rent a car. This hotel is on Shelter
Island and overlooks Marina in San Diego Bay. It has a beautiful pool,
and if any of you do want to bring your families, it's an excellent
vacation hotel.  
  
The meeting will start on Tuesday, February 7th at 8:30 AM and end
Thursday, February 9th at 3:00 PM.
