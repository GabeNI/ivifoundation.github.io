> > > > our LXI-IVI block rate. I'm suggesting a couple of things:
> > > > 
> > > > > 1\. Make your room reservation using the registration link
> > > > > below as soon as possible, and don't forget to register with
> > > > > [**Barb**](mailto:bode.admin@comcast.net), so you're in the

> > > > > 
> > > > > 2\. As always, please stay at this hotel in San Diego, instead

> > > > > meet the terms of the contract. If we fall short of our
> > > > > promised room reservations, LXI and IVI will pay penalties for
> > > > > the lost revenue. IVI is overlapping the LXI meeting on Wed.
> > > > > for our joint security meeting as you know, and we have
> > > > > estimated that LXI and IVI will both be present at Wednesday's
