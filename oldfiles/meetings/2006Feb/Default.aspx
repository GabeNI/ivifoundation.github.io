These rooms are reserved under the name IVI Foundation and are eligible for the special group rate of $119/night.  You can call (800) 922-2336 or (619) 222-0561 to make reservations, or you can book online with the following steps:  <br />

The Island Palms is located about seven minutes from San Diego Airport.  A complimentary airport shuttle is available from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm by calling the hotel direct at (619) 222-0561 from the Baggage area.  Taxis are available at less than $10.  A rental car is probably not necessary as there are many good restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.  The hotel also offers free internet access to its guests, as well as free parking should you decide to rent a car.  This hotel is on Shelter Island and overlooks Marina in San Diego Bay.  It has a beautiful pool, and if any of you do want to bring your families, it's an excellent vacation hotel.<br />

The meeting will start on Tuesday, February 7th at 8:30 AM and end Thursday, February 9th at 3:00 PM. <br />
