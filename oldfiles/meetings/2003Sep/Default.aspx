To: All IVI members;<br />
<br />
I am very pleased to tell you that we have located a very nice hotel in Portland Oregon to host our next IVI meeting. Thanks to Badri Malynur and Fatima, his administrative assistant, for their help.<br />
<br />
The hotel is:<br />
<br />
The Benson Hotel<br />
<br />
309 Southwest Broadway<br />
<br />
Portland, OR 97205<br />
<br />
Phone: 503-228-2000<br />
<br />
Fax: 503-471-3920<br />
<br />
Our group Room rate is $100 per night. Please mention the IVI Foundation meeting when making your reservations to get this room rate. Please make you reservations at least 30 days prior to the first meeting day, or by August 7th.<br />
<br />
The Benson Hotel is located in the heart of downtown Portland, within a few short blocks of shopping arts center, parks and museums. The hotel is listed in the National Registry of Historic Places, and has been renovated recently. It also offers complimentary wine tasting nightly located in their "secret" Wine Cellar.<br />
<br />
You will not need a car, as the Benson is located within the MAX light rail system. You can get aboard the MAX Red Line light rail train at the airport to City Center. Get off in downtown Portland at the Pioneer Square North MAX Station. Walk 0.2 miles north (about 4 short blocks) to the Benson, 309 SW Broadway. The one way ticket from the airport to downtown is $1.55. Travel time is 44 minutes (including 6 minutes walking.) During the week, transportation within the downtown area is free on MAX.<br />
<br />
Finally, the hotel does have wireless high-speed Internet access but there is an extra charge.<br />
<br />

If your Credit Card is on fill at the IVI Consortium office and you wan to use the same card, simply mark that on your registration.

        and FAX it (safer) to me.<br />
<br />
