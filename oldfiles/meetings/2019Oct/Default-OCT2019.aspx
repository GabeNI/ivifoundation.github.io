          <p><strong>Agenda</strong> (To view/download, <strong><a href="Oct 2019 Agenda - IVI.pdf">click here</a></strong>.)</p>
          <p>We are holding our  IVI meeting from Mon. October 7th - Wednesday, October 9th, 2019. We are staying at the DOUBLETREE SUITES, NASHVILLE AIRPORT. The cost of your room is $159 per night with our IVI-LXI block rate. Please reserve your room as soon as possible before <strong>9/22/2019</strong>. </p>
          <p>I'm suggesting a couple of things:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>1. Make your room reservation using the registration link below as soon as possible, and don't forget to register with <a href="mailto:admin@ivifoundation.org"><strong>Barb</strong></a>, so you're in the headcount for catering.</p>
            <p>2. As always, please stay at this hotel in Nashville, instead of somewhere else, because we need everyone's participation to meet the terms of the contract. If we fall short of our promised room reservations, LXI and IVI will pay penalties for the lost revenue.  IVI is overlapping the LXI meeting on Wed. for our joint security meeting as you know, and we have estimated that IVI and LXI will both be present at Wednesday's lunch.</p>

                <p>Or, you can call their reservations center directly - (615) 889-8889.  Advise the Reservation Agent of the Group Name, Bode Enterprises.  This will ensure that they are booked within your group room block (<strong>Code: BOD</strong>) at the corresponding group rate ( $<strong>159</strong>). Your guestrooms will be returned back to the Hotel&rsquo;s general inventory after your reservation cut-off date.   All reservations requested after the <strong>cut-off date (Sept. 22)</strong> will be made on a space available basis and will be sold at our best available rate. </p>
