The hotel is near the airport (abour 6.5 miles) but for shopping and restaurants you may want a car.  For transportation from the Airport, the hotel provides shuttle service.  Go to the hotel kiosk at the airport and find the Marriott South Airport, dial the front desk and they will send a shuttle (about 10-15 minutes).<br />
