Courtyard by Marriott San Diego Rancho Bernardo hotel borders Scripps Poway & Carmel Mountain Ranch just North of San Diego. Located in San Diego's North County, Rancho Bernardo is considered by many to be the jewel of the city with an abundance of world class golf clubs and wineries. While golfing in San Diego / Rancho Bernardo you will enjoy the world class service that you have come to expect from Marriott. We are the closest Marriott to The Wild Animal Park and are just a short drive to Sea World, The San Diego Zoo and Balboa Park. The hotel is located just minutes from local companies such as Sony, Nokia, NCR, BAE Systems, Northrop Grumman and HP. If shopping is in your plans, you can enjoy nearby retail stores such as Target, Gap and Sharper Image. We look forward to serving you during your visit to San Diego. <br />

<h2>Hotel Reservations</h2>
Fred and I worked hard to find a high quality hotel at affordable prices in the increasingly popular San Diego area.  The hotel room rate has been negotiated down to $129/night.  Please mention the IVI Foundation meeting when making your reservation.  The block of rooms will be reserved until <strong>Friday, April 27, 2007 or whenever the group block is full</strong>, so please make your reservations ASAP.  (Contact me directly in case the room block fills up.) At the Cut-Off Date, Hotel will review the reservation pick up for the Event, release the unreserved rooms for general sale, and determine whether or not it can accept reservations based on a space- and rate-available basis at the IVI Foundation group rate after this date.  <br />
<br />
We know you can use other hotels with corporate rates and may save some money, but we highly recommend that you book rooms at this hotel to avoid penalties to the IVI Foundation.  It's newly renovated, situated on a beautiful lake, and a relatively quick drive to downtown San Diego or the airport.  It has all the amenities of a good business hotel.  <br />
<br />
        <em><span style="text-decoration: underline">

I look forward to seeing you all in San Diego.<br />
