          <p><strong>Agenda</strong> &#40;TBD&#41;</p>
        <p>Currently the world has implemented changes to ensure the health and safety of all people during the COVID-19 pandemic.  These measures include working from home, social distancing, stopping travel and cancelling conferences.</p><p>Due to these changes, the IVI Meetings will be held via video conference instead of in person.  We will have many of the same topics scheduled for the meeting that were planned before the change.  Once the agenda has been developed for the virtual conference, it will be accessible from the Agenda link above.</p>
        <p>The IVI Foundation encourages you to continue to practice healthy and safe habits during this challenging time.  Please stay safe and well.</p>
          <!--<p>Our next IVI meeting will be Monday, June 15th - Wednesday, June 17th, 2020. We will stay at the <strong><a href="https://www.eurostarshotels.co.uk/eurostars-park-hotel-maximilian.html">Eurostars Park Hotel Maximilian</a></strong>.
