      <p><strong><a href="Oct 2017 Agenda - IVI.pdf">Meeting Agenda</a></strong></p>
      <p><br>
      We are holding our October IVI Meeting from Monday, Oct. 16 -- Wednesday, Oct. 18. We are staying at the<strong> Courtyard by Marriott Portland City Center</strong>,  cost of the room is $179 per night with our IVI-LXI block rate. I'm suggesting a couple of things: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. Make your room reservation using the registration link below as soon as possible, and don't forget to register with <a href="mailto:admin.lxi@lxistandard.org">Julie</a>, so you're in the headcount for catering. (Julie Minor has replaced Barb Estes as administrator/bookkeeper for the IVI Foundation.)</p>
        <p>2. As always, please stay at this hotel in Portland, instead of somewhere else, because we need everyone's participation to meet the terms of the contract. If we fall short of our promised room reservations, IVI and LXI will pay penalties for the lost revenue.  IVI is overlapping the LXI meeting on Wed. morning for our joint Cybersecurity meeting as you know, and we have estimated that IVI and LXI will both be present at Wednesday's lunch.</p>
        <blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>
        <p><strong>IVI Meeting Fee:</strong></p>
        <p>We will be trying something new at this meeting to make the collection of meeting fees more efficient. Bob will estimate the meeting fees for attendees and call-ins prior to the meeting, and collect credit card payments for the attendees' meeting fees in Portland. For the call-ins, their meeting fees will be collected after the Board verifies who called in.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Attendees meeting fee: $310</p>
          <p>Call-in meeting fee: $155</p>
