The hotel is very near Disneyland, and has free shuttle service to Disneyland, so you may want to consider bringing your family. For transportation from the Airport, the hotel recommends using Mears Transportation. You can call Mears at 800-223-3868. Cost is $16/person one way or $28 round trip. No reservations are needed. There are restaurants close enough to walk and many within a few minutes by cab or car.<br />
<br />
If you are renting a car, the directions to the hotel from Orlando Int’l Airport are as follows:<br />
<br />
Take the BEE LINE EXPRESSWAY heading West all the way to Interstate 4 (I-4), then take I-4 West to Exit 64B. This will place you on HWY 192 heading West. The Clarion Maingate is located 2 miles on the right hand side at Mile Marker #5.<br />
