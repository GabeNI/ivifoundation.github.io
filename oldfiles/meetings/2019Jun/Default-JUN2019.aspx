          <p><strong><a href="June 2019 Agenda - IVI.v2.docx">Agenda</a></strong></p>
          <p>We are still 10 rooms short of our contract, so please make your reservation as soon as possible before May 20th.          </p>
          <p>We are holding our June IVI Meeting Wed., June 5<span style="text-align: center"> - Friday, June 7, 2019</span>. We are staying at the <strong>HILTON SAN DIEGO AIRPORT/HARBOR ISLAND</strong>,  cost of the room is $189 per night with our LXI-IVI block rate. I'm suggesting a couple of things: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>1. Make your room reservation using the registration link below as soon as possible, and don't forget to register with <a href="mailto:bode.admin@comcast.net"><strong>Barb</strong></a>, so you're in the headcount for catering.</p>
            <p>2. As always, please stay at this hotel in San Diego, instead of somewhere else, because we need everyone's participation to meet the terms of the contract. If we fall short of our promised room reservations, LXI and IVI will pay penalties for the lost revenue.  IVI is overlapping the LXI meeting on Wed. for our joint security meeting as you know, and we have estimated that LXI and IVI will both be present at Wednesday's lunch.</p>
