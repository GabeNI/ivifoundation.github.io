We&#65533;re holding the IVI Boston Meeting, Wed., 10/17 &#65533; Fri., 10/19 at the 
Woburn/Boston North Courtyard Marriott hosted by The MathWorks.  <br />

        <strong>
Hotel Room Reservations: <br />
        </strong>
<br />
        <em>
By phone:  <br />
<br />
        </em>
Reservations for the hotel rooms will be made by individual attendees directly 
with Courtyard by Marriott reservations at (781) 938-9001. Reservations must be 
received on or before <strong><em>Wednesday, September 26, 2007</em></strong>, 
or whenever the room block is filled. At the Cutoff Date or when the block is 
filled, the Courtyard will review the reservation pickup, release the unreserved 
rooms, if any, for general sale, and determine whether it can accept 
reservations based on a space- and rate-available basis at the IVI Foundation&#65533;s 
group rate after this date. Mention &#65533;IVI Foundation&#65533; to get the group rate of 
$129/night (regular rate is $179/night). The hotel seems adamant about sticking 
with this cutoff date for this meeting, so I would not count on this being 
extended. There is a strong demand for rooms in Boston at this time. <br />
<br />
        <em>
Online:<br />
        </em>
<br />
Go to the hotel website at <a href="http://www.marriott.com/boscw" target="_blank">
www.marriott.com/boscw</a>
        and enter the group code, IVIIVIA, in the Group code box on the right of 
the home page in the Check Rates &amp; Availability section. Then follow the 
instructions to reserve your room. If everything is correct you&#65533;ll see the room 
rate of $129/night and a designator IVI Foundation &#65533; Math. <br />

For the first time at this meeting, we will be charging a flat rate of
