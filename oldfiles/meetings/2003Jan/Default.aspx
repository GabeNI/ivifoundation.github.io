For the January 2003 IVI Foundation meeting in Austin we are asking that all IVI Foundation members who plan to attend the meeting use this page to pre-register. This will allow the meeting organizers to get a better estimate of the number of people who will be attending, allowing them to better distribute the cost among the attendees. Please fill out the form below and submit it at your earliest convenience, but no later than Monday, Jan 20, 2003. Please do not include multiple people on the same form. Every attendee must submit a pre-registration form.  Cost will be $50/day for all pre-registered attendees for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and $30 for Thursday.
