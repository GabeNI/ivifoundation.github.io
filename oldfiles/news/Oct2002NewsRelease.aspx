            <strong>Foundation Demonstrates Benefits of New Specifications at AUTOTESTCON</strong>

            <strong>NEWS RELEASE – Oct. 15, 2002 – </strong>The Interchangeable Virtual Instrumentation (IVI) Foundation, an open consortium of companies that sets software standards for instrument interchangeability, announced the completion of all the specifications required for IVI-compliant instrument drivers and systems. The new IVI specifications help users meet engineering challenges, such as preserving software on long-life test systems when instruments become obsolete, or maximizing the use of existing resources by deploying a single test software system on to test systems built with different instrument hardware.

        The Interchangeable Virtual Instrumentation (IVI) Foundation, an open consortium of companies that sets software standards for instrument interchangeability, announced the completion of all the specifications required for IVI-compliant instrument drivers and systems. The new IVI specifications help users meet engineering challenges, such as preserving software on long-life test systems when instruments become obsolete, or maximizing the use of existing resources by deploying a single test software system on to test systems built with different instrument hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
        At the recommendation of the IVI Technical Committee earlier this year, the foundation’s board of directors approved nine core architectural specifications and eight instrument class specifications. The architectural specifications define the framework for all IVI instrument drivers and the mechanism engineers can use to interchange instruments. The IVI Foundation designed the framework to provide C or COM driver interfaces that are usable in a wide variety of development environments. These specifications also define features that make the drivers easy to use and include advanced capabilities such as simulation and state caching.
        </p>
        <p>
        The class specifications deliver common programming interfaces for communicating with instruments of the same class. The specifications cover the following classes: DC power supply, digital multimeter, function and arbitrary waveform generator, oscilloscope, power meter, RF signal generator, spectrum analyzer, and switch. Engineers who use these common programming interfaces can exchange instruments with few or no changes to their test program software.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition, the IVI Foundation completed implementation and testing of the IVI shared components, which are basic building blocks for all IVI instrument drivers. These components perform common system services and ensure that IVI instrument drivers from multiple vendors are interoperable in the same system.
        </p>
        <p>
        “The completion of these specifications gives members the framework to create IVI-compliant drivers and gives engineers around the world the freedom to build high-performance test systems more productively,” said Joe Mueller of Agilent Technologies, President of the IVI Foundation. “These specifications not only promote interchangeability, they also give vendors the opportunity to increase their customers’ ease of use by creating higher quality, consistent drivers.”
        </p>
        <p>
        At AUTOTESTCON today, the IVI Foundation presented demonstrations of the new specifications from a number of member companies, including Agilent, Keithley, National Instruments, and Rohde & Schwarz. The demonstrations highlighted the ability of the IVI architecture to provide the following user benefits: ease of integration and use, simulation, speed through state caching, multi-vendor interoperability, and hardware and software interchangeability. After today’s press conference in Huntsville, Ala., the IVI Foundation plans to present the new specifications at Electronica in Munich, Germany, in November of 2002.

            <strong>About the IVI Foundation</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        The IVI Foundation was formed in 1998 and officially incorporated in 2001. With the IVI Foundation standard instrument driver specifications, engineers can swap instruments without recompiling software, resulting in significant savings in time and money. The IVI Foundation’s membership includes end-users, major instrument and software vendors, and system suppliers and integrators who are dedicated to defining software standards for instrument interchangeability. The foundation’s board of directors is comprised of representatives from the following 10 companies: Agilent Technologies, Keithley Instruments, National Instruments, Pacific MindWorks, Racal Instruments, Rohde & Schwarz, Tektronix, Teradyne, TYX Corp., and Vektrex Electronic Systems.
