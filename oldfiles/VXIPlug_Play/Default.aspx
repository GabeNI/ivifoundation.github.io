        <p>
            The VXI<em>plug&amp;play</em> Systems Alliance was an organization whose 
			members shared a common commitment to end-user success with open, 
			multivendor VXI systems. The alliance accomplished major 
			improvements in ease of use by endorsing and implementing common 
			standards and practices in both hardware and software, beyond the 
			scope of the VXIbus specifications. The alliance used both formal 
			and de facto standards to define complete system frameworks. These 
			standard frameworks gave end-users &quot;plug &amp; play&quot; interoperability at 
			both the hardware and system software level.

            <strong>Integration into the IVI Foundation</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The VXI<em>plug&amp;play</em> Systems Alliance voted to become part of 
			the IVI Foundation in late 2002 and the IVI Foundation Board of 
			Directors voted to accept the merger in the spring of 2003. The VISA 
			technical committee of the VXI<em>plug&amp;play</em> Systems Alliance 
			has been meeting in conjunction with the IVI Foundations meetings 
			since 2002, and it is now formally integrated into IVI IVI has 
			assumed control of the VXI<em>plug&amp;play</em> specifications and all 
			ongoing work will be accomplished as part of the IVI Foundation.
